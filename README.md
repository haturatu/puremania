Pure Mania is a simple, lightweight, and fast web-based file manager written in Go. It provides a clean and intuitive interface for managing your files and directories remotely.  
  
## Features  
  
- **File and Directory Management:** List, create, delete, and move files and directories.  
- **File Operations:** Upload, download, and view file content.  
- **Bulk Operations:** Download multiple files as a ZIP archive and delete multiple files at once.  
- **Search:** Quickly find files on your storage.  
- **Storage Information:** View details about your storage capacity and usage.  
- **Simple Configuration:** Easy to set up using a `.env` file.  
- **ls --collor like output**: Color-coded file listings for better readability.
- **No Database Required:** Pure Mania uses the filesystem directly, eliminating the need for a database.
- **Media Preview**: Preview images and play audio/video files directly in the browser.
- **Web Editor**: Edit text files directly within the web interface.
  
## Getting Started  
  
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.  
  
### Prerequisites  
  
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version 1.18 or later)  
  
### Installation & Building  
  
1.  **Clone the repository:**  
    ```bash  
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/puremania.git  
    cd puremania  
    ```  
  
2.  **Build the application:**  
    The provided `build.sh` script will handle dependencies and build the binary for you.  
    ```bash  
    ./build.sh  
    ```  
  
### Configuration  
  
1.  **Create a configuration file:**  
    Copy the example `.env` file to create your own configuration.  
    ```bash  
    cp .env.example .env  
    ```  
  
2.  **Edit the `.env` file:**  
    Open the `.env` file and customize the settings to match your environment. See the [Configuration](#Configuration) section for more details.  
  
### Running the Application  
  
After building and configuring, you can run the application:  
  
```bash  
./puremania  
```  
We place static assets in the static directory, but as long as you can call the API implemented on the Go side, anything will work. The frontend is only there for my own convenience.  

### Supervisor (Optional)
To run Pure Mania as a background service, you can use a process manager like `supervisord`. Hereâ€™s an example configuration:  
 
```ini
[program:puremania]
command=/home/tux/git/puremania/puremania
user=tux
directory=/home/tux/git/puremania
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stderr_logfile=/home/tux/git/puremania/puremania.log
stderr_logfile_maxbytes=1MB
stdout_logfile=/home/tux/git/puremania/puremania.out.log
stdout_logfile_maxbytes=1MB
stdout_logfile_backups=0
stderr_logfile_backups=0
environment=PATH="/home/tux/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/home/tux/.tux/bin:/home/tux/.cargo/bin:/home/tux/.npm-global/bin",PYTHONPATH="/home/tux/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages",HOME="/home/tux"
```
you can save this configuration in a file like `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/puremania.conf` and then update `supervisord` to apply the changes:  
 
```bash
sudo supervisorctl reread
sudo supervisorctl update
sudo supervisorctl start puremania
```

## Usage  
  
Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:  
  
`http://localhost:8844`  
  
*(The port may be different if you changed it in your `.env` file.)*  
  
## Configuration  
  
The following environment variables can be configured in the `.env` file:

| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |  
| `STORAGE_DIR`      | The main storage directory for your files.      | `/home/$USER`        |  
| `MOUNT_DIRS`       | Comma-separated list of additional directories. | (empty)              |  
| `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` | Maximum file size for uploads in megabytes.     | `100`                |  
| `PORT`             | The port on which the server will run.          | `8844`               |  
| `ZIP_TIMEOUT`      | Timeout in seconds for ZIP file creation.       | `300`                |  
| `MAX_ZIP_SIZE`     | Maximum size in MB for files to be zipped.      | `1024`               |
